# Resizable ([Frontend](../../frontend.md))

A utility module providing resizability functionality for renderables. Should expect a *width* and a *height* attribute of the target element. Should allow the disabling of resizing a certain dimension - since nodes will not be resizable vertically in their height.

## Requires

- [Comments](../../renderables/comments/comment.md)
- [Groups](../../renderables/groups/group.md)
