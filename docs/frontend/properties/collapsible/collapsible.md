# Collapsible ([Frontend](../../frontend.md))

Functionality that can be applied to nodes, comments and groups - allowing them to be collapsed into a more compact format, hiding most complexity within their content. Nodes still need to showcase their incoming and outgoing connections, however, the representation can be made more abstract.

## Requires

- [Comments](../../renderables/comments/comment.md)
- [Groups](../../renderables/groups/group.md)
- [Nodes](../../renderables/nodes/node.md)

## Required By

*Nothing*
