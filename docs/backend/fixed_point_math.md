# Fixed Point Math

The compiler represents number literals as strings. These strings need to be parsed and mathematical operations need to be performed on them, without introducing data type specific inaccuracies such as floating point rounding errors.

Contains functionality for:
- Parsing of number literals
- Mathematical operations (non exhaustive):
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division
    - Modulo
    - Exponentiation
    - Logarithm
    - Maximum
    - Minimum
    - Ceiling
    - Floor
    - Round
    - Root
    - Sine
    - Cosine
    - Tangent
    - Arcsine
    - Arccosine
    - Arctangent
    - Vector Dot Product
    - Vector Cross Product
    - Matrix Multiplication
